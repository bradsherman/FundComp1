	For the first two problems in this report, the programs were very simple and
straightforward. However, on the last one, I decided to make a tip calculator.
This program is meant to take two inputs from the user, their bill, and the 
percentage that they would like to tip, and then calculate their total bill
and display it to the screen. 

	From the programmer's perspective, this program opens by printing a 
welcome statement and then declaring two float variables for the bill and 
the tip percentage. Next, it asks for the user's bill, scans it into the 
variable "bill", and checks to make sure that the value is positive. Then 
it does the same thing for the "tip" variable. If the program discovers 
that a variable is negative, it prints "That is not a valid answer" and 
exits the program with a return 0 statement. 

	Lastly, a float variable "total" is declared for the final bill. Then 
the program calculates the total with the formula 
total = bill*(1+(tip/100)). Then the program displays that total and 
thanks the user.
