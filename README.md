This is the repo for the course: Fundamentals of Computing 1, which I took during the Fall of 
2015 during my sophomore year at Notre Dame.

Fundamentals of Computing 1 taught me the basics of programming while learning the C language.
This was my first, programming course other than a few courses online at codecademy.com. This
course gave me a solid foundation of the basic principles of programming.
