life is life
go for it
that's all folks
you only live once
how about them apples
here's looking at you kid
we're gonna need a bigger boat
you talking to me?
that's how the cookie crumbles
do you feel lucky, punk?
go irish!
luke I am your father
you play ball like a girl!
heroes get remembered, but legends never die
so you're saying there's a chance!
it's not the size of the dog in the fight, it's the size of the fight in the dog
